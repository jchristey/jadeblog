    "text": "Note: in the analysis below ‘mothers’, ‘pregnant women’, and ‘maternal mortality’ are referenced, as these are the terms employed by the World Health Organization. However, some individuals who are pregnant may not identify as women or view themselves as mothers.\nMaternal mortality is an important factor of reproductive health that is sometimes overlooked but vital in terms of the health and wellness of family structures as a whole, and potentially telling of overarching trends from region to region as rates of maternal mortality change. By having a more in-depth knowledge of where this is being observed most and what factors usually accompany higher rates of maternal mortality, global and local governments can better reassign resources to address places with higher rates, in order to increase reproductive health everywhere and promote reproductive justice.\n\n\n\n\nHow have global trends of maternal mortality changed over time?\nIs the state of maternal health getting better or worse?\nWhat factors reduce maternal mortality?\nWhat does this data analysis tell us about the futures of maternal health?\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis uses World Health Organization (WHO) data for:\n\n‘Maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births’\n‘Percent of live births with a skilled health professional present’\nCountry income level (low, low-middle, high-middle, or high), based on the World Bank categorization\n\n\n# Import our datasets\nimport pandas as pd\nWHOdata = pd.read_csv('WHOdata.csv',encoding='latin-1')\nWorldBank = pd.read_csv('WorldBankIncome.csv',encoding='latin-1')\n\n\n# Merge datasets by country\nWHOdata_all = WHOdata.copy()\nWHOdata_all = WHOdata_all.merge(WorldBank, how='left', left_on='Country (string)', right_on='DisplayValue')\n\n\n# Check that they merged correctly\nWHOdata_all.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      PUBLISH STATES (string)\n      Year (string)\n      WHO region (string)\n      Country (string)\n      Births attended by skilled health personnel (%) (string)\n      Births attended by skilled health personnel (%) (numeric)\n      Births attended by skilled health personnel (%) (comment)\n      Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births) (string)\n      Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births) (numeric)\n      Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births) (low)\n      ...\n      LANGUAGES_EN_2012\n      WHO_REGION\n      WHO_REGION_CODE\n      World Bank income group\n      World Bank income group code\n      SHORTNAMEES\n      SHORTNAMEFR\n      WHOLEGALSTATUS\n      World Bank income group GNI reference year\n      World Bank income group release date\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Published\n      2000\n      Africa\n      Algeria\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      161 [ 115 -

We therefore want to narrow down the countries that do have relevant data for analysis. Based on initial exploratory data analysis, most countries have data from the years 2000 to 2017, with less reliable data after that, that then will become our range.\n\n# Filter for countries with data for both 2000 and 2017\nfiltered_datasets = []\n\nfor year in range(2000, 2017):\n    filtered_data = WHOdata_all.loc[(WHOdata_all['Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births) (numeric)'] >= 1) \n                                    & (WHOdata_all['Year (string)'] == str(year))]\n    filtered_datasets.append(filtered_data)\n\nprint(filtered_datasets[16][['Country (string)']])\n\n     Country (string)\n3086          Algeria\n3087           Angola\n3088            Benin\n3089         Botswana\n3090     Burkina Faso\n...               ...\n3267        Singapore\n3268  Solomon Islands\n3269            Tonga\n3270          Vanuatu\n3271         Viet Nam\n\n[183 rows x 1 columns]\n\n\nUsing this newly established range from 2000 to 2017, we can graph maternal mortality ratio in relation to births attended by skilled health personnel over the years.\nAdditionally, we’ve colored the dots in relation to the country’s region, as outlined by the WHO in order to better track countries over the course of the yearly animation.\n\nall_data = pd.concat(filtered_datasets)\n\nfig1 = px.scatter(all_data,\n           x=\"Births attended by skilled health personnel (%) (numeric)\", \n           y=\"Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births) (numeric)\",\n           hover_name='Country (string)',\n           animation_frame='Year (string)',\n           color=\"WHO_REGION\")\n\nfig1.update_layout(yaxis_range=[0, 2500])\nfig1.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nAs we can see in the graph above there does seem to be a general trend towards a reduction in maternal mortality with an increase in the percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel.\nThough there is some difficulty in each individual country nearer the bottom right of the graph, this representation has the added benefit of focusing on countries with relatively higher maternal mortality ratios and/or lower percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel. This information could be useful in terms of knowing which countries to particularly focus on in terms of reducing maternal mortality, or alternatively finding countries that are successful in keeping maternal mortality low despite a low percentage of births attended by health professionals.\nNext, the bar graph below shows maternal mortality ratio, however here countries are sectionned by its income group, as assigned by the World Bank. The format of the bar graph allows us to more directly observe the relationship between countries and also between country income groups.\n\nall_data = all_data.sort_values(by=[\"Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births) (numeric)\"], ascending=False)\nfig2 = px.bar(all_data,\n           x=\"Country (string)\", \n           y=\"Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births) (numeric)\",\n           hover_name='Country (string)',\n           animation_frame='Year (string)',\n           color=\"World Bank income group\")\n\nfig2.update_layout(yaxis_range=[0, 2500])\nfig2.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nAs we can tell from the bar chart above, there is a stark difference between maternal mortality ratios according to a country’s income group.\nIt is however hard to see the intricacies of country level changes at this scale. Therefore below I’ve seperated these nations by income level. Note the change in y-axis range in the bar charts below:\nHigh income: 0-100\nUpper middle income: 0-500\nLower middle income: 0-1250\nLow income: 0-2500\n\nall_data = all_data.sort_values(by=[\"Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births) (numeric)\"], ascending=False)\n\nall_data_high = all_data.loc[all_data[\"World Bank income group\"] == \"High income\"]\n\nfig_high = px.bar(all_data_high,\n                  x=\"Country (string)\", \n                  y=\"Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births) (numeric)\",\n                  hover_name='Country (string)',\n                  animation_frame='Year (string)')\n\nfig_high.update_layout(yaxis_range=[0, 100])\nfig_high.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\nall_data_low = all_data.loc[all_data[\"World Bank income group\"] == \"Low income\"]\n\nfig_low = px.bar(all_data_low,\n                  x=\"Country (string)\", \n                  y=\"Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births) (numeric)\",\n                  hover_name='Country (string)',\n                  animation_frame='Year (string)')\n\nfig_low.update_layout(yaxis_range=[0, 2500])\nfig_low.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\nall_data_midlow = all_data.loc[all_data[\"World Bank income group\"] == \"Lower middle income\"]\n\nfig_midlow = px.bar(all_data_midlow,\n                  x=\"Country (string)\", \n                  y=\"Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births) (numeric)\",\n                  hover_name='Country (string)',\n                  animation_frame='Year (string)')\n\nfig_midlow.update_layout(yaxis_range=[0, 1250])\nfig_midlow.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\nall_data_midhigh = all_data.loc[all_data[\"World Bank income group\"] == \"Upper middle income\"]\n\nfig_midhigh = px.bar(all_data_midhigh,\n                  x=\"Country (string)\", \n                  y=\"Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births) (numeric)\",\n                  hover_name='Country (string)',\n                  animation_frame='Year (string)')\n\nfig_midhigh.update_layout(yaxis_range=[0, 500])\nfig_midhigh.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nFrom the plots above we can tell that there is certainly a general trend of a reduction in maternal mortality ratios. However, I am curious as to whether there are countries where the maternal moratality ratio is increasing rather than decreasing.\nThis next analysis looks at maternal mortality ratios in comparison to past ratios as opposed to comparing between countries. This holds the particular benefit of seeing how countries compare to themselves year after year.\nTo do this, filtered to only have non nul maternal mortality ratios for the years 2000 and 2017, then printed the names of countries which had a higher maternal mortality in 2017 than in 2000, thus representing an increase in maternal mortality over this period.\n\nfiltered_datasets = []\nfor year in range(2000, 2018):\n    filtered_data = WHOdata_all.loc[(WHOdata_all['Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births) (numeric)'] >= 1) \n                                    & (WHOdata_all['Year (string)'] == str(year))]\n    filtered_datasets.append(filtered_data)\n\nall_data = pd.concat(filtered_datasets)\n\ngrouped_data = all_data.groupby(['Country (string)', 'Year (string)'])['Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births) (numeric)'].mean().reset_index()\npivoted_data = grouped_data.pivot(index='Country (string)', columns='Year (string)', values='Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births) (numeric)').reset_index()\nhigher_2017 = pivoted_data[pivoted_data['2017'] > pivoted_data['2000']]\n\nprint(list(higher_2017['Country (string)']))\n\n['Brunei Darussalam', 'Canada', 'Dominican Republic', 'Haiti', 'Jamaica', 'Kuwait', 'Lebanon', 'Libya', 'Mauritius', 'Saint Lucia', 'Syrian Arab Republic', 'United States of America', 'Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)']\n\n\nAs we can see, this returned 13 countries that have an increasing maternal mortality ratio, which are (thankfully) the minority.\nThe increase in maternal mortality ratio in some of these nations may be partially due to war or political unrest (ex: Syria, Venuzela) or natural disaster (ex: Haiti). In any case this increase is a worrisome indicator for reproductive health of the country.\nOne may be shocked to see high income nations of the ‘Global North’ apparent in this list such as Canada and the United States, who though keep their maternal mortality ratio low at a global standard have seen an increase from 2000 to 2017.\n\nUS = WHOdata.loc[WHOdata['Country (string)']=='United States of America']\nUS.plot(x='Year (string)', y='Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births) (numeric)')\n\n<AxesSubplot: xlabel='Year (string)'>\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see in the graph above, though having a comparatively low maternal mortality ratio at the global scale, the United States has been privy to a steady increase in maternal mortality over the course of this time frame.\nInstead of comparing countries between themselves by ratio, it may be more relevant to compare how much a country has changed its maternal mortality ratio over this timeframe. This somewhat takes away resource-specific factors and acknowledges that some nations may struggle more than others to maintain low maternal mortality, however, they may have been successful in greatly reducing their own rates over time.\nTo do so, we have created a dictionary to store countries along with its mean change over this period. Thus creating a new ratio which can be used to compare a country’s average change. Once this is created it can be converted to a dataframe to then represent the countries with the highest average change (increase in maternal mortality ratio) and lowest average change (reduction in maternal mortality ratio).\n\nchanges = {}\n\ncountry_list = WHOdata['Country (string)'].unique().tolist()\nfor country in country_list:\n    country_data = WHOdata.loc[WHOdata['Country (string)'] == country]\n    change = country_data['Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births) (numeric)'].pct_change()\n    changes[country] = change\n\navg_changes = {}\nfor country, change in changes.items():\n    avg_change = change.mean()\n    avg_changes[country] = avg_change\n\n# Filter out NaN values\navg_changes_no_nan = {k: v for k, v in avg_changes.items() if not pd.isna(v)}\n\n# Sort the average changes \nsorted_avg_changes = sorted(avg_changes_no_nan.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])\ntop_avg_changes = dict(sorted_avg_changes[-10:])\nbottom_avg_changes = dict(sorted_avg_changes[:10])\n\n\ncombined_dict = {**top_avg_changes, **bottom_avg_changes}\ndf_changes = pd.DataFrame(combined_dict.items(), columns=['Country', 'Average Change'])\n\n\nfig = px.bar(df_changes.sort_values(by='Average Change', ascending=False), \n             x='Country', y='Average Change', color='Average Change',\n             color_continuous_scale='RdYlBu_r', title='Maternal Mortality Ratio Changes (Top 10 and Bottom 10)')\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nAs we can see here, the U.S. had the highest positive change (meaning the highest increase in maternal mortality ratio), a very worrisome stat despite the hyper-medicalization of the U.S. healthcare system.\nAlternatively, in blue tones, we can see the countries in which there has been the starkest reduction in maternal mortality, with Belarus leading the charge.\n\n\n\nThough this analysis is somewhat limited in scope due to potential holes in the data acquired, it still holds the benefit of highlighting countries that may require more support in terms of maternal medical care and thus demand more robust policies and infrastructure to lower rates of maternal mortality. Nevertheless, the overall, global reduction in maternal mortality is a relative success to be built upon for the improvement of the health of mothers and families everywhere.\nThe above analysis does indicate that both presence of skilled health personnel and the income level of countries has an impact on the ratio of maternal mortality of said country. It is however, important to note that these are not the only factors at play, as shown by the example of the United States’ increase in maternal mortality over the period observed. Maternal health thus needs to be upheld by rigorous medical standards, as well as robust infastructure and policy that empowers women to give birth without fear of preventable complications, while increasing equity in reproductive health."
